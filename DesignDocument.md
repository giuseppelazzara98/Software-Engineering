# Instructions

The design must satisfy the Official Requirements document, notably functional and non functional requirements, and be consistent with the APIs

# High level design 

<discuss architectural styles used, if any>
<report package diagram, if needed>






# Low level design

<for each package in high level design, report class diagram. Each class should detail attributes and operations>









# Verification traceability matrix
